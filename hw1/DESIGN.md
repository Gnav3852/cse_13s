## introduction

In this homework, I will do the thing and solve important computer science
problems and probably win a
[Turing Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award) for doing so.

TODO(you): I will create 5 functions regarding basic mathematics

## function 1: area_of_disk

Given a positive radius R area_of_disk returns the area of a circle. The function uses Pi*R^2 for calcuation.

## function 2: area_of_ring

Given an outer radius R and inner radius L area_of_ring returns the area of the ring. The ring is classified by area occupied by the outer ring but not the inner ring.

## function 3: bigger_minus_smaller

Given two numbers I, J bigger_minus_smaller finds the bigger number and returns Greater number - Lesser number.

## function 4: value_in_range

Given three numbers I(lower bound), J(a value), K (upper bound) value_in_range returns True if the value is in range of lower and upper. Otherwise it returns false. K will always be greater than I.

## function 5: sum_of_greater_squares

 Given three numbers a, b, c sum_of_greater_squares takes the two largest squares of a,b,c and returns the addition of them.

## the caat program

Given an input file (stream of characters) the caat program reads each character and outputs it. If is a vowel (a, e, i, o , u) it returns two of that vowel.
