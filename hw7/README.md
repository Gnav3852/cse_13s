# homework 7: Hash tables, I/O and strings

**Due date: Friday, 14 March 2024, 11:59pm**

# You Have Options!

OK. So for Homework 7, you have options.

If you want to keep it safe, you are completely free to do the tried and true
version of homework 7, which is the [Customer Database](customer_database.md). 

If you're looking to get a little bit experimental, let's do the BRAND NEW AND
EXCITING [search engine](search_engine.md) project!

You only need to do one of these homeworks!

# deliverables

Whichever project you choose, you're given very little structure to work with.
You're going to need to design your program with at least one library (with a
corresponding .h file containing your function declarations and data
structures), some sensible tests, and a main interaction loop in a separate
file.

  * design docs are due on Wednesday
  * your whole program is due on Friday (but if you need a little bit more time,
    we'll be flexible)

## reading

You should read...
  * _The C Programming Language_ by Kernighan & Ritchie, Chapter 6 (for some
    background on hash tables)
  * _The C Programming Language_ by Kernighan & Ritchie, Chapter 7 (to
    understand the I/O happening here).
  * _The C Programming Language_ by Kernighan & Ritchie, Chapter 8 (more
    discussion of I/O, also an explanation of realloc).
